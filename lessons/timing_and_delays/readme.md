# **Comprehensive Notes on Verilog Timing and Delays**  

Timing and delays in Verilog are essential for simulating hardware behavior accurately. They define how signals propagate over time and how sequential elements behave.

---

## **1. Types of Delays**  
Verilog provides different types of **delays** to model circuit timing:

| **Delay Type** | **Syntax** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **Regular Delay** | `#time` | Delays execution by a fixed time |
| **Inertial Delay** | `#(min:typ:max)` | Models gate propagation delays |
| **Transport Delay** | `transport #time` | Ensures all changes are transmitted, ignoring glitches |

---

## **2. Regular Delays (`#time`)**  
A simple `#time` delay holds execution for the given number of **time units**.

### **Example: Simple Delay**
```verilog
module delay_example;
    reg a, b;

    initial begin
        a = 0;
        #10 a = 1;  // Change 'a' after 10 time units
        #5 b = 1;   // Change 'b' after 5 more time units
    end
endmodule
```
ðŸ”¹ **Delays are useful for testbenches and simulation but not for synthesizable hardware design.**

---

## **3. Inertial Delay (`#(min:typ:max)`)**  
Used for modeling **gate delays** with minimum (`min`), typical (`typ`), and maximum (`max`) values.

### **Example: Inertial Delay in Gate Modeling**
```verilog
module inertial_delay_example(output y, input a, b);
    assign #2 y = a & b;  // Delay of 2 time units
endmodule
```
ðŸ”¹ **Synthesis tools ignore inertial delays since actual gates have fixed propagation delays.**

---

## **4. Transport Delay (`transport #time`)**  
- Ensures **all** input changes are transmitted after a given delay.  
- Unlike inertial delay, it **does not ignore glitches**.  

### **Example: Transport Delay Behavior**
```verilog
module transport_delay_example;
    reg a;
    
    initial begin
        a = 0;
        #2 a = 1;
        #3 a = 0;  // Normally ignored in inertial delay
    end
endmodule
```
ðŸ”¹ **Use transport delay when modeling **signal propagation in interconnects**.**

---

## **5. Event-Based Timing Control**  
Delays can also be controlled using **events** like `@`, `posedge`, and `negedge`.

| **Control Type** | **Syntax** | **Description** |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Wait for a signal change** | `@(signal)` | Waits for any change in `signal` |
| **Wait for a rising edge** | `@(posedge signal)` | Waits for a **rising edge** (`0 â†’ 1`) |
| **Wait for a falling edge** | `@(negedge signal)` | Waits for a **falling edge** (`1 â†’ 0`) |

### **Example: Edge-Based Timing Control**
```verilog
module edge_example;
    reg clk, data;

    initial begin
        data = 0;
        @(posedge clk) data = 1; // Wait until clk rises
    end
endmodule
```

---

## **6. Non-Blocking Delayed Assignments (`<= #time`)**  
- Used in **sequential logic** to schedule updates **without blocking** execution.

### **Example: Non-Blocking Assignment with Delay**
```verilog
module nonblocking_delay_example;
    reg a, b;
    
    initial begin
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
        #10 a <= 1;  // Scheduled update after 10 time units
        #5 b <= 1;   // This executes immediately, not delayed by 'a'
    end
endmodule
```
ðŸ”¹ **Use `<=` in always blocks for flip-flops and sequential logic.**

---

## **7. Timing Control with `wait` Statement**  
The `wait` statement pauses execution until a condition is **true**.

### **Example: Using `wait` Statement**
```verilog
module wait_example;
    reg ready;
    
    initial begin
        ready = 0;
        #10 ready = 1;
        wait (ready); // Wait until 'ready' becomes 1
        $display("Ready signal detected at time %0t", $time);
    end
endmodule
```
ðŸ”¹ **Useful for synchronization in testbenches.**

---

## **8. Fork-Join for Parallel Execution with Delays**  
Verilog allows **parallel execution** of delayed statements using `fork-join`.

### **Example: Parallel Execution of Delays**
```verilog
module fork_delay_example;
    initial begin
        fork
            #5 $display("Task 1 at time %0t", $time);
            #10 $display("Task 2 at time %0t", $time);
            #15 $display("Task 3 at time %0t", $time);
        join
    end
endmodule
```
ðŸ”¹ **Use `fork-join_any` or `fork-join_none` for better control over parallel execution.**

---

## **9. Synthesis Considerations**
ðŸ”¹ **Delays (`#time`) are ignored during synthesis!**  
- Delays are **only used in simulation** and **not synthesizable**.  
- To model real timing, use **flip-flops and clocks** instead of explicit delays.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **`#time` Delays:** Used for **testbenches** and **simulation**.  
- **Inertial Delay (`#(min:typ:max)`)**: Models **gate propagation** delays.  
- **Transport Delay (`transport #time`)**: Passes **all** signal changes (glitches included).  
- **Event-Based Timing:** Use `@()`, `posedge`, `negedge` for edge-sensitive execution.  
- **Non-Blocking Delays (`<= #time`)**: Schedule assignments for sequential logic.

- **Fork-Join with Delays:** Runs **parallel tasks** with timing constraints.  
- **Synthesis Ignores Delays:** Replace delays with **clocked logic** in synthesizable code.
